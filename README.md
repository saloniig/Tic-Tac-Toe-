Tic-tac-toe game using Android

Welcome to TicTacToe.

This tic-tac-toe game was developed using Android Studio, the official integrated development environment for Google's Android operating system, designed specifically for Android development. If you donâ€™t have Android Studio yet, you can download it at  [https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)  The game itself allows two humans (player X and player O, no AI) to compete again each other. The layout is very simple. A 9 square grid, where player X and player O compete against each other. Whenever there is a draw or someone wins, the game displays which player won along with the option to play the game again.

How do you start building it? Once You have download and installed Android Studio, you can start a new project with a activity template, the blank one to begin building the app. The first thing you will want to do is set up the layout for the game, A 9 square grid vertically on top and a play again button on button. Once the layout is figured out, you are good to go for the coding part.
